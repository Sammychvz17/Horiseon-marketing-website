# Horiseon-marketing-website

This client wanted me to refractor old code and make it more efficent. I added semantic elements and accesibiliy to the site. I added some article and section elements to give the syntax a oringized feel. It will also allow for the screen reader to understand the conent. I fixed a broken link by updating the ID.
